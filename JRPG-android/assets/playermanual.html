<h2><a name="getstarted">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>At the initial 'Main Menu' screen tap the button titled 'Play'</p>
<p>This will bring to a menu that will allow you to choose between 'Single Player,' '2P Pass&Play,' 'Quick Mission,' or returning back to the main menu.</p>
<p>In the future an online multiplayer option will be present.</p>
<h3>Single Player</h3>
<p>You will be playing alone against the computer AI.</p>
<p>The difficulty you have set in options will determine the maximum number of an enemy aliens that will spawn per turn.</p>
<h3>2 Player Pass & Play</h3>
<p>One player will control the humans and the other player will control the aliens.</p>
<p>Difficulty settings will also effect the number of spawns the alien player will receive per turn.</p>
<h3>Quick Mission</h3>
<p>A single player option in which you will be dropped into a randomly selected mission either from the stock maps that ship with Intrinisic Violence or from your custom maps collection.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="options">Options</a></h2>
<h3>Player Name</h3>
<p>The first option you can configure is your player name. This is used for tagging your custom maps as having been created by you and will also be used in the future if online multiplayer support is added.</p>
<h3>Difficulty</h3>
<p>Your difficulty settings modifies the number of alien spawns that are allowed per turn. Easy is -1 from the map specified amount, Normal makes no changes, Hard adds +1 spawn, and Elite adds +2 spawns per turn from the number specified for that map.</p>
<p>No matter the map settings the number of alien spawns will never be less than 1 per turn and never exceed 5 per turn.</p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>There are three settings available for lighting.</p>
<p><b>OFF (Fasted)</b>: turns off lighting calculations, which will increase performance marginally on devices with less processing power.</p>
<p><b>Flat Shading</b>: will shade each cell on the map consistently across that cell, performance impact is mostly negligible even for Android 2.3.3 era devices.</p>
<p><b>Smooth Shading</b>: is the slowest setting in which the lighting attributes of a cell are smoothed across the area of that cell. It produces the most visually appealing results but is the slowest performance-wise.<p>
<h3>SFX</h3>
<p>You may turn SFX on or off. The volume is controlled via your device's media volume settings.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>You may turn Music OFF, specify low volume, or specify normal volume. 'Low' volume will play at half of your media volume settings to provide just ambience. 'Normal' will play at the volume of your media volume settings.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="rules">Universal Rules</a></h2>
<p>Intrinsic Violence is a turn-based strategy game,</p>
<p>The first key item to point out is that each turn is limited in length, at 3 minutes to complete your turn. While often more than enough time, you will find yourself periodically having to make decisions quickly against the clock. You may manually end your turn by pressing the 'End Turn' button in the bottom right of the screen.</p>
<p>Each 'piece' on the board gets a certain number of 'Action Points' which are spent performing actions such as moving, shooting, operating doors, or unjamming weapons.</p>
<p>A human piece will normally have 4 action points while an alien piece will normally have 6 action points.</p>
<p>You are not required to spend all of your action points for a particular piece in a single sitting, you may freely change piece selections at any time and resume control of the previous piece - ie. you may first move one piece out of the way of another so it can move past, and then move that original piece back into position.</p>

<h3><a name="control" />Controlling Pieces</h3>
<p>During your turn either tap on a piece of yours on the in-game map, or on the listing card for it in your roster on the left.</p>
<p>The roster lets you know whose selected by highlighting them in GREEN and showing those that are dead in RED. You may still tap on a dead roster card to find the corpse should you want to send a medic.</p>
<p>You can also see what weapon/s they have equipped and how much ammunition they have in their current magazine and know what how many of what kind of grenade they are carrying.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b> There are buttons for 'View Info' and 'View Inventory' for human characters in a roster. 'View Info' will give you a summary of that unit's skills. 'View Inventory will let you see what gear they have with them and what is equipped.</b>
<p>This will bring up a list of actions (listed with their cost to perform as well) that the piece may perform in the top-right.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the map will be displayed indicated cells which you may tap to move, turn, or perform special actions.</p>
<p>A square with a <b>'straight arrow' icon</b> idicates that you tap there to <b>move</b> your piece into that position.</p>
<p>A square with a <b>'circular arrow' icon</b> indicates that you may tap there to <b>turn</b> your selected piece to face that direction.</p>
<p>Example special actions would include 'Vault' which allows your piece to jump over a piece blocking its' way, and 'Demolish' which will destroy alien map entrance points to prevent them from spawning at that point in the future.</p>

<h3><a name="actions"/>The Actions List</h3>
<p>The actions that are not map related are displayed in a list at the top right.</p>
<p>Only those Actions your piece has Action Points to afford will be displayed.</p>
<p><b>Burn - 2AP</b>: a piece with a flamethrower may perform this action to fire without having a target. Use this to block directions of approach preemptively.</p>
<p><b>Close Door - 1AP</b>: closes any open doors in squares neighboring the selected piece.</p>
<p><b>Reload Weapon - 2AP</b>: reloads ammunition for active weapon. Depletes 1 ammo magazine as well.</p>
<p><b>Unjam Weapon - 1AP</b>: unjams a weapon that has jammed (refer to the following section for status indicators.</p>
<p><b>Revive Fallen - 4AP</b>: if the piece has the 'Medical' skill he may revive dead comrades in neighboring squares with a 50% success rate.</p>
<p><b>Ready Grenades - 0AP</b>: shows 'bomb' indicators on the map at places where you may toss a grenade by tapping the indicator.</p>
<p><b>Putaway Grenades - 0AP</b>: stops showing the 'bomb' indicators on the map at places where may toss a grenade by tapping the indicator.</p>
<p><b>Crouch - 1AP</b>: crouching allows another piece behind the crouching piece that is standing to fire past the piece. This allows you to double up your firepower.</p>
<p><b>Stand Up - 0AP</b>: remove the crouching status of the piece.</p>
<p><b>Stand Guard - 2AP</b>: the piece will enter guard mode. While in guard mode it will open fire on any enemy piece that moves/turns/attacks within it's line of sight. Any non-firing action will terminate guard mode automatically.</p>
<p><b>Stop Guard - 0AP</b>: generally unnecessary, as movement and other actions will cease guard mode automatically.</p>
<h3>Special Notes About Actions</h3>
<p>Note that if a piece starts the turn in guard mode, and then unjams or reloads its' weapon, it will no longer be in guard mode and you will have to spend 2 Action Points to put the piece back into guard mode.</p>
<p>Be careful with grenades, you may accidentally kill a few of your own pieces that are in proximity of the blast sight.</p>

<h3><a name="combat"/>Combat</h3>
<p><b>Shooting:</b> With a piece selected tap on an enemy piece to shoot at it. The selected piece must have an unblocked line of sight with a 90 degree arc from it's current facing.</p>
<p><b>Melee:</b> you cannot shoot at pieces which are in direct contact on the N/S/W/E axes. Tapping on the piece will result in a melee combat. This is not advised when playing as a human, with the exception of certain pieces with melee focused load-outs.</p>
<p>Melee is the only means most aliens have to attack, while it is the least desireable situation to attack in for most humans.</p>
<p>Every <u>UNIQUE</u> attacker who attacks a piece in melee combat during a turn will reduce the results of the victim's close combat rolls by -1.</p>
<p>This means if engaged by a second alien from another direction, the defending human will receive a -1 to his 1d6 close combat roll.</p>
<p>If engaged from the front, melee combat goes both ways and the attacker has a chance of being killed. If attacked from any other side the defender may not attack back, but if the defender survives he will be reoriented to face that attacker should it attack again.</p>
<p>If engaged from the back-side, the defender gets an additional -1 to their close combat roll, on top of any other penalties for multiple attackers that turn.</p>

<h3><a name="gear"/>Equipment</h3>
<p>Weapons come in several different classes and are all have randomly generated attributes. This may be a close combat bonus, ammo clip size, bonus damage, etc./p>
<p><b>Light Machine Gun Class Weapons:</b> The standard class of equipment. No real perks. Magazine sizes will vary per model.</p>
<p><b>Heavy Machine Gun Class Weapons:</b> The advantage of a HMG is that is designed for sustained rapid fire. Therefore any shots fired that hit the target will not cost any Action Points.</p>
<p>However, once you've fired a heavy machine gun, the piece will no longer be able to move, aside from turning in place.</p>
<p>You can gun down a whole lot of targets around you, but you become an almost sitting duck.</p>
<p><b>Flamethrower Class Weapons:</b> unleash a short distance cone of fire that will persist for 2-3 turns depending on the model received. Has tactical significance for clearing rooms, blocking enemy approach, blocking enemy Line of Sight, and sometimes completing objectives.</p>
<p><b>Pistol Class Weapons:</b> their small size confers a +1 bonus in melee combat. Not very common typically.</p>
<p><b>Sword Class Weapons:</b> derived from monomolecular utility blades. Adds a bonus dice-roll to close combat and a chance to 'block' enemy attacks in melee combat. Makes close combat less suicidal.</p>
<p><b>Ripper Class Weapons:</b> similar to the 'Katar daggers' of ancient earth. Provides 2 bonus dice-rolls in close combat and a +1 to the final result. This is the best way to engage in close combat. However, they cannot be wielded along with a firearm.</p>
<p><b>Frag Grenades:</b> thrown via 'Readying Grenades' from the action list and tapping a valid square with the bomb icon displayed. Will kill the occupant of the square on 2+ of 6 sided die, and will kill anyone in neighboring squares on a 3+ on a 6 sided die.</p>
<p><b>Smoke Grenades:</b> thrown via 'Readying Grenades' from the action list and tapping a valid square with the bomb icon displayed. The target square and the neighboring squares will be consumed with smoke. Smoke blocks Line of Sight, so should only be used against enemies with ranged combat capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Incediary Grenades:</b> throw via 'Readying Grenades' from the action list and tapping a valid square with the bomb icon displayed. The target square and the neighboring squares will be set on fire. Fire prohibits safe movment (3+ on a d6 chance of being wounded) and blocks Line of Sight.</p>

<h3><a name="inventory"/>Inventory and Gear</h3>
<p>In the roster list on the left, there is a button for 'Inventory' which will bring up a list of what gear your piece is carrying.</p>
<p>Items that are equipped with be highlighted in GREEN.</p>
<p>You may unequip these by tapping the unequip button beside the label</p>
<p>You may also equip an item that isn't equipped by tapping the 'Equip' beside the label.</p>
<p>Gear conflicts are resolved automatically in the simplest manner possible. So you need not unequip in order to equip something else.</p>
<p>There is also an 'Info' button for each item which will bring up a textual description of the item. This description will cover information such as magazine size, number of clips left, bonus, and detriments.</p>

<h3><a name="looting"/>Looting</h3>
<p>You may loot on squares that contain either a human corpse or contains a depiction of firearms / alien relics within the tile.</p>
<p>When looting from a corpse be aware that if you take their weapons they will not be eligible for 'Revive Fallen' from someone with the 'Medical' ability. You're safe to just take their grenades though.</p>
<p>The option to loot appears in the <b>Actions Menu</b> in the upper right when you are standing on a square that you may loot.</p>
<p>Tapping the 'Loot' button will bring up a list of items that you may take from the square</p>
<p>To take an item just tap the 'Take' button to the right of the listed item.</p>

<h3><a name="skills"/>Human Skills</h3>
<p>Human characters will receive between 2 and 3 randomly selected skills.</p>
<p><b>Close Combat</b>: +1 to close combat rolls per level.</p>
<p><b>Marksmanship:</b> + 1 to hit when shooting per level.</p>
<p><b>Medical:</b> receives the 'Revive Fallen' Action which can be used to revive dead pieces. Base 50% chance, +10% per level</p>
<p><b>Agile:</b> receives the 'Vault' action which is a map action that is used to 'jump' over pieces in the way of this piece.</p>
<p><b>Efficiency:</b> gets +1 AP per level, for 5 Action Points added max.</p>
<p><b>Survival:</b> works in tandem with Medical skill, increases the odds of successfully being revived significantly.</p>
<p><b>Piloting:</b> may activate and use power-suit armor if available.</p>
<p><b>Demolitions:</b> adds the Demolish map action to this piece, which allows it to destroy alien spawn points. Pretty risky getting that close to a spwan though.</p>
<p><b>Science Engineering:</b> this piece will repair generators much more quickly than others.</p>
<p><b>Science Alien:</b> may equip alien relics as a powerful weapon.</p>
<p><b>Scavenger:</b> gets improved results from looting tiles with loot.</p>
<p><b>Robotics:</b> this piece is able activate robotic drones to join the team. If this piece is lost, all active drones will cease operation unless someone else also has Robotics lvl1+. 1 drone per level.</p>

<h3><a name="winning"/>Winning The Game</h3>
<p>At the top of the roster is a button labeled 'Objectives.' Clicking this will bring up a list of conditions which you much satisfy to be deemed the victor of the mission.</p>
<p>Some objectives will have a 'Show On Map' options beside them, this will center your view at least one instance of a target for that objective and also show objectives of the type as markers on the in-game map.</p>
<p>It's advised to take advantage of the first turn to review your objectives thoroughly if they were not covered in the mission description. The first turn is generally the safest in most cases and will be more about moving into an initial position than anything else.</p>

<h2><a name="twoplayer">2 Player Pass & Play Rules</a></h2>

<h3><a name="playtwo"/>The Basic Format</h3>
<p>The game will start as the human player's turn. Once the player has completed their turn by either time-out or manually ending the turn a message box will appear telling the human player to pass the device to the alien player.</p>
<p>The alien player's turn is split into two parts discussed below.</p>

<h3><a name="bealiens"/>Playing as Aliens</h3>
<p>The alien player plays what may be called a sort of '2 turns.'/p>
<p>The first stage of the alien player's turn is to place new alien spawns, spawn points will be indicated in green and show a 'cracked egg' icon.</p>
<p>Once all aliens are spawned, or there are no 'un-blocked' available spawn points (those that have been destroyed or have an alien already standing their recently spawned) the next stage will begin.</p>
<p>The second stage is identical to playing as a human player in regards to moving pieces and engaging in combat.</p>
<p>Once the alien player is done or time has run out, a message will appear telling the player to pass the device to the human player.</p>
<p>This will repeat until someone wins</p>
